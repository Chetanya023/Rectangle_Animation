# Rectangle Animation with Pygame:

# Overview:

• Developed a Python script using the Pygame library to create a dynamic rectangle animation.

# Interactive Size and Movement:

• Three rectangles of different colors move diagonally across the screen with adjustable speed.

• The size of the rectangles dynamically changes, creating a visually appealing animation.

# Rectangles' Characteristics:

• Green rectangle: Standard movement and size change.

• Red rectangle: Vertical movement with size variation.

• Blue rectangle: Horizontal movement with size adjustment.

# Smooth Size Transition:

• Implemented smooth size transitions for all rectangles, providing a fluid and continuous visual experience.

# User-Friendly Controls:

• The animation is customizable, allowing users to adjust parameters such as speed, size change factor, and initial positions.

# Limit Handling:

• Rectangles wrap around the screen when reaching the edge, creating a seamless animation loop.

# Continuous Animation Loop:

• The script ensures a continuous animation loop, offering an endless display of the dynamic rectangles.
